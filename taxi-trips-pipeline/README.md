# Taxi Trips Batch Pipeline (PySpark)

A small data engineering project that reads raw taxi trip data, checks its quality,
cleans it, summarizes it, and saves the results in an analytics-friendly format.

## What it does

1. **Extract**: reads CSV or Parquet trips, or generates 50,000 fake trips if no input is given.
2. **Validate**: enforces a schema and tags bad rows with a reason (negative fare, dropoff before
   pickup, missing distance). Bad rows go to their own output instead of being silently dropped.
3. **Transform**: adds speed and fare-per-km columns, removes impossible values, then builds a
   daily summary per zone with a 7-day rolling average and a daily revenue ranking (window functions).
4. **Load**: writes Parquet files, with the clean trips partitioned by date.

## Run it

```bash
pip install pyspark      # also needs Java installed
python taxi_trips_job.py                                   # uses generated sample data
python taxi_trips_job.py --input data/trips.parquet --output out/   # uses your own data
```

Output folders:

- `clean_trips/`: cleaned trips, one folder per pickup date
- `rejected_trips/`: rows that failed validation, with the reason
- `daily_zone_summary/`: daily trips, revenue, median fare, rolling average and rank per zone

## Tech

Python, PySpark (DataFrames, window functions, partitioned Parquet writes).

## Ideas for next steps

- Schedule it daily with Airflow or Dagster
- Load the summary into Postgres or DuckDB
- Add unit tests for the validation rules
- Show the results in a Streamlit dashboard
